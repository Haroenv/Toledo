                        <h3>Toledo in a nutshell</h3>
                        <p>Toledo started in September 2001 as a university wide e-learning project. The main goal was to support the implementation of guided independent learning by means of a state of the art virtual learning environment. From September 2004 onwards, Toledo became the Common Virtual Learning Environment of the KU Leuven Association.</p>
